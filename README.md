## Overview
This repository contains code for my 2020 master's thesis exploring machine learning for X59 and Y34 garbage code redistribution. The code is structured as follows:
```
.
├── analysis # pipeline to launch classifiers and perform model evaluation
├── manuscript # figures/tables/number plugging for manuscipt
├── maps # excel files pertaining to attributes of models
├── misc # misc scripts to vet model outputs
├── thesis_data_prep # formatting and mapping raw input data
├── thesis_utils # various functions essential to pipeline
├── README.md
