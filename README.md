# MPH Thesis Project - X59 and Y34 Garbage Code Redistribution
## Author: Kareha Agesa
## Anticipated Completion: Spring 2020

This project contains code for my masters thesis on X59 and Y34 garbage code redistribution. It is dependent on data and infrastructure belonging to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).* Current structure is as follows:
* `sepsis_testing` - an _unorganized_ R project using the sepsis data to experiment with the [tree package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tree/tree.pdf) 
* `code` - code implementing machine learning and poisson methods

* Is dependent on multiple cause of death data belonging to IHME, sources IHME central functions, and reads in files housed on IHME's cluster computing system.
